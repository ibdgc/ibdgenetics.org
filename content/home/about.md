The International Inflammatory Bowel Disease Genetics Consortium (IIBDGC) focuses on collecting large datasets through participating research groups across a broad set of countries, all working in collaboration. In addition to enabling wider genetics discovery, we also attempt to explore what functional associations can be derived within diverse populations. Our current work takes this further, involving analysts from dozens of research groups using the latest statistical techniques to look for patterns across 250+ regions.
