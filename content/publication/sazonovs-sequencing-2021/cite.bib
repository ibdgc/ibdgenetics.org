 abstract = {Abstract
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified hundreds of loci associated with Crohns disease (CD), however, as with all complex diseases, deriving pathogenic mechanisms from these non-coding GWAS discoveries has been challenging. To complement GWAS and better define actionable biological targets, we analysed sequenced data from more than 30,000 CD patients and 80,000 population controls. We observe rare coding variants in established CD susceptibility genes as well as ten genes where coding variation directly implicates the gene in disease risk for the first time.},
